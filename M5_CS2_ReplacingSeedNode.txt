
Problem: Replacing a Seed Node

1. Design and implement a plan and replace a seed node.
   
   -> Record the datacenter, address and rack settings of the dead node, we will use this later
   -> Add the replacement node to the network and record its IP address
       Join
   -> On the existing node, gather setting information for the new node from the cassandra.yaml file of dead node:
       cluster_name
       endpoint_snitch
       rpc_address
       listen_address
   -> Add the following option to cassandra-env.sh file:
       JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Dcassandra.replace_address = address_of_dead_node
   -> Now Start the Replacement Node with the following command
       cassandra -Dcassandra.replace_address = address_of_replacement_node
