
Since we work with the e-commerce industry it is good to keep strong consistency and we can asure no customer drop off due to unavilabilty of data.

1. Ideally How many Cassandra nodes(minimum) you should have in your cluster to make sure it is highly available?
   ANS: we should keep minimum 3 nodes in the cluster to ensure the service availability
2. What will be the replication factor and why?
   ANS: As we set 3 node cluster we can set replication factor to 3
3. What will be consistency levels for both Read and Write? Provide explanation whichever level you choose.
   ANS: 
   Read CL = QUORUM (Cassandra contacts majority of the replica nodes) gives you a nice balance, it gives you high performance reads, good availability and good throughput.
   Write CL = QUORUM so complete write operation is successful if a simple majority (2 replica nodes here) of the nodes respond success.
4. If price and inventory are changing frequently what will be your ideal approach to handle them?
   ANS: if price inventory changing frequently we need to ensure that the partition will not span across multiple clusters. So we have to ensure right data model with proper partitioning
5. If you are getting frequent updates, what should be your strategy or assumption while designing schema?
   ANS: we can expect high data growth so that we need to increase the cluster size by adding new nodes
